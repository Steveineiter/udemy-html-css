Its also amazing that i can use VIM in this project :D see my shell-setup readme for commands.
We are using prettier linter.

## HTML notes:

1. We should use only ONE h1 tag.
2. We should NOT use \<b> for bold text but \<strong> in HTML5. This is called semantic HTML.
3. We should not use \<i> for italic, but \<em> in HTML5, reason as above.
